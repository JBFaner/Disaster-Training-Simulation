# AI Scenario Generation - Main Focus

## 🎯 Pinaka-Focus ng AI Generate-Scenario

### **1. REALISTIC & LOCALIZED SCENARIOS** ⭐⭐⭐
**Primary Focus:** Gumawa ng realistic scenarios na specific sa **Barangay San Agustin, Novaliches, Quezon City**

**Ano ang ginagawa:**
- Gumagamit ng local context (streets, buildings, community characteristics)
- Philippine LGU context - hindi generic international scenarios
- Specific location details para mas authentic

**Example:**
- ❌ Generic: "A building in a city experiences an earthquake"
- ✅ Localized: "A 3-story residential building along Quirino Highway in Barangay San Agustin experiences a magnitude 6.5 earthquake during rush hour, affecting nearby schools and market areas"

---

### **2. DIVERSE & UNPREDICTABLE SCENARIOS** ⭐⭐⭐
**Primary Focus:** Iwasan ang repetitive, predictable scenarios

**Ano ang ginagawa:**
- Every generation = unique scenario
- Different challenges every time
- Unpredictable events para hindi ma-memorize ng trainees

**Why Important:**
- Traditional training = same scenarios = rote memorization
- AI generation = different every time = adaptive thinking

**Document Reference:**
- Chapter I, Section 1.3: "Lack of Scenario Diversity and Realism: Current drills are often based on predictable, repetitive scripts"

---

### **3. TRAINING-APPROPRIATE COMPLEXITY** ⭐⭐
**Primary Focus:** I-adjust ang complexity based sa difficulty level

**Ano ang ginagawa:**
- **Basic:** Simple scenarios, clear instructions
- **Intermediate:** Moderate complexity, some challenges
- **Advanced:** Complex scenarios, multiple challenges, cascading failures

**Example:**
- Basic: Single disaster, clear evacuation route
- Advanced: Multi-hazard (earthquake + fire + power outage), blocked routes, communication failure

---

### **4. PRACTICAL CHALLENGES FOR LGU PERSONNEL** ⭐⭐
**Primary Focus:** Real-world challenges na makikita ng LGU personnel

**Ano ang ginagawa:**
- Resource limitations (limited equipment, personnel)
- Communication issues (network down, radio problems)
- Evacuation challenges (crowded areas, blocked exits)
- Decision-making under pressure

**Why Important:**
- Hindi theoretical - practical challenges
- Based sa actual LGU operations
- Realistic resource constraints

---

### **5. STRUCTURED OUTPUT FOR TRAINING** ⭐
**Primary Focus:** Generate complete scenario structure para sa training

**Ano ang ginagawa:**
- **Title:** Clear, descriptive scenario name
- **Description:** Detailed 2-3 paragraph scenario
- **Initial Conditions:** Starting situation
- **Challenges:** List of challenges personnel must address
- **Expected Actions:** What personnel should do
- **Safety Notes:** Important warnings
- **Learning Objectives:** What trainees should learn

**Why Important:**
- Complete scenario structure
- Ready to use for training
- Includes evaluation criteria (expected actions)

## 📊 Focus Priority Ranking

| Focus Area | Priority | Why Important |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Realistic & Localized** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Core requirement - must be specific to Barangay San Agustin |
| **Diverse & Unpredictable** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Solves main problem - repetitive scenarios |
| **Training-Appropriate Complexity** | ⭐⭐ | Ensures scenarios match skill level |
| **Practical LGU Challenges** | ⭐⭐ | Makes training relevant and useful |
| **Structured Output** | ⭐ | Makes scenarios usable immediately |

## 🎯 What Makes It Different from Manual Scenarios?

### Manual Scenario Creation:
- ❌ Time-consuming (hours to create one)
- ❌ Repetitive (same patterns)
- ❌ Limited diversity
- ❌ Generic (not always localized)
- ❌ Predictable (trainees memorize)

### AI-Generated Scenarios:
- ✅ Fast (5-10 seconds)
- ✅ Unique every time
- ✅ Highly diverse
- ✅ Localized automatically
- ✅ Unpredictable (forces adaptive thinking)
